# Food Villa

---

## Food Villa is a simple food ordering app which resembles Swiggy in UI and some of the functionalities.

- The app is built with `ReactJS` for the frontend library, `TailwindCSS` for rapid prototyping/styling, `Redux Toolkit` to manage a centralised store of states, `ContextAPI` to showcase state management for smaller states, `React Router v6` for handling routes amd paths, and uses `Parcel` as a bundler.

- The goal of this app is to reinforce frontend concepts in ReactJS and its ecosystem. A lot of the core fundamental concepts are covered and showcased in this app, and can be improved as more concepts are learned along the way.
